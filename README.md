# Fall-Damage-Not-Included
The game was created as the final project for the first year of a game development course. It was developed by me and three other classmates.

During the second semester, we were tasked with creating a small game to serve as the final project for the class that taught Unity. My three classmates and I decided to create a mix of platforming with parkour.

In the game, the player goes through a quick tutorial area to learn the mechanics. After that, they are placed in an arena with one objective: to climb.

For the concept of the game, our main references were games like "Getting over it," "Titanfall 2," and "Mirror's Edge." 
We wanted to mimic the satisfaction and fluidity of the movement in Titanfall 2. 
"Getting over it" gave us the idea that if the player falls, even when they are at the top, they have to restart, making the game challenging but addictive, if a bit frustrating. 
"Mirror's Edge" served as the main inspiration for the visual design. In that game, the environment is mostly white, so the player is guided by colored assets in the game. With that idea in mind, we twisted it a bit. What if, instead of an open city with a bright environment, we create a closed and dark environment like those found in laser tag arenas? Thus we created the visual style present in the game

The game is available to download on my [itch.io page](https://comandante-vicno.itch.io/fall-damage-not-included).
