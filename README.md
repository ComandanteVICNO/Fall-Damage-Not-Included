# Fall-Damage-Not-Included
A game created as a final project for the 1st year of a gamedev course. It was developed by me and 3 other class mates.

During the second semester, we were tasked with creating a small game to serve as a final project for the class that tought Unity.
Me and 3 other classmates decided to create a mix of platforming with parkour.

In the game, the player goes though a quick tutorial area in order to learn the mechanics, after that, they are palced in an arena with one objective... Climb.

For the concept of the game, our main references were games like "Getting over it", "Titanfall 2" and "Mirror's Edge".
We wanted to mimic the satisfaction and fluidity of the Titanfall 2 movement. 
Getting over it gaves the idea that, if the player falls, even if they are at the top, they have to restart, making the game challaging, but addictive, if a bit frustrating.
Mirror's Edge served as a main base for the Visual Design. In that game, the enviroment is mostly white, as so, the player is guided by colored assets in the game. With that idea, we twisted it a bit, what if instead of an open city with a bright enviroment, we make a closed and dark enviroment as seen in laser tag arenas.

The game is available to download on my [itch.io page](https://comandante-vicno.itch.io/fall-damage-not-included).
